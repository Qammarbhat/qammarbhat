# 👋 Hi, I'm Qammar Bhat

### 💡 Passionate about Core Computer Engineering with a Modern Edge

I’m a curious technologist who thrives at the intersection of **computer engineering fundamentals** and **cutting-edge innovation**. My work blends the depth of systems and infrastructure with the intelligence of AI — rooted in solid engineering principles and shaped by modern tech demands.

## 💼 What I Work On (Most to Least)

- **AI Infrastructure & High-Performance Systems**: Building efficient, scalable computing environments using remote GPU servers, WSL2, CLI/SSH, and automation workflows.
- **Deep Learning & GenAI**: Developing and fine-tuning models in domains like speech, vision, and text — exploring LLMs, ASR, and multimodal learning.
- **Time Series Forecasting & Applied ML**: Creating robust pipelines and deploying forecasting models in real-world production settings.
- **Quantum Computing & Omni-Computing Concepts**: Exploring hybrid models combining quantum, classical, and AI computation.
- **Web Development & UI/UX**: Learning full-stack fundamentals with attention to modern design and interaction.
- **Creative Tech**: Delving into graphic design and video editing for branding, storytelling, and content creation.
- **Foundational Engineering**: Studying computer architecture, operating systems, DSA, and low-level programming (C/C++) for a holistic understanding.

## 🗣️ Beyond Tech

Outside of engineering and innovation, I'm deeply interested in **human connection** — working with people, understanding perspectives, and developing the art of meaningful conversation. Whether it’s collaborating on ideas, leading discussions, or just being present in a room full of thinkers, I’m on a journey to become a better **listener, communicator, and conversationalist**.

I believe the future isn't just built on code — it's built on **clarity, empathy, and collaboration**.
