## 💼 What I Work On (Most to Least)

- **AI Infrastructure & High-Performance Systems**: Building efficient, scalable computing environments using remote GPU servers, WSL2, CLI/SSH, and automation workflows.
- **Deep Learning & GenAI**: Developing and fine-tuning models in domains like speech, vision, and text — exploring LLMs, ASR, and multimodal learning.
- **Time Series Forecasting & Applied ML**: Creating robust pipelines and deploying forecasting models in real-world production settings.
- **Quantum Computing & Omni-Computing Concepts**: Exploring hybrid models combining quantum, classical, and AI computation.
- **Web Development & UI/UX**: Learning full-stack fundamentals with attention to modern design and interaction.
- **Creative Tech**: Delving into graphic design and video editing for branding, storytelling, and content creation.
- **Foundational Engineering**: Studying computer architecture, operating systems, DSA, and low-level programming (C/C++) for a holistic understanding.
